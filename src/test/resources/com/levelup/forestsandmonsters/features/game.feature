I want to create a new custom character, setting only their name.
This split is VERY simple, to get us started. Just barebones game functionality.

Scenario Outline:: Set character name
    Given the character's name is <characterNameInput>
    When the character sets their name
    Then the Game sets the character's name to <characterNameOutput>
    Examples:
        | characterNameInput | characterNameOutput |
        | "Erin"          | "Erin"           |
        | ""              | "Character"         |
