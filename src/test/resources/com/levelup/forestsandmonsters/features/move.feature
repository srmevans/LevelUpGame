Feature: Move in a direction

    I want to move my character. If they attempt to move past a boundary, the move results in no change in position.

Scenario Outline: Move in a direction
    Given the character starts at position with XCoordinates <startingPositionX>
    And starts at YCoordinates <startingPositionY>
    And the player chooses to move in <direction>
    When the character moves
    Then the character is now at positon with XCoordinates <endingPositionX>
    And YCoordinates <endingPositionY>
    Examples: 
        | startingPositionX | startingPositionY | direction | endingPositionX | endingPositonY | 
        | 0 | 0 | NORTH | 0 | 1 |
        | 0 | 0 | SOUTH | 0 | 0 |
